## 📜 About the Project  

The **Open Source World Chronicle** is an experiment in collective memory:  

- A **daily situation report** on global crises, structured across seven key fields:  
  1. Geopolitics & Security  
  2. Economy & Finance  
  3. Climate & Environment  
  4. Migration & Demography  
  5. Technology & Information  
  6. Society & Politics  
  7. Health & Biological Risks  

- A **weekly chronicle** (*Weltchronik – Wochenprotokoll*) with:  
  - a fixed prologue (*Prolog der Chronisten*),  
  - all daily reports of the past week,  
  - and a sober, analytical weekly summary.  

- Always **bilingual**: German 🇩🇪 and English 🇬🇧.  
- Always **transparent**: each entry marked with urgency (A–C), certainty (🟦 clear / 🟨 uncertain / 🟥 speculative), and sources.  
- Always **time-stamped**: dual format (MEZ/MESZ and UTC).  
- Always **archived**: Markdown format, versioned on GitHub.  

This is **not journalism, not propaganda, not fiction**.  
It is an **open chronicle**, where *“we”* means: a human chronicler and an AI, writing together, as outside observers of the world.

## 🔭⚖️ Why "Open Source"?  

- **Open** → Everyone can read, fork, verify, and comment.  
- **Source** → All statements are transparent, with explicit references and certainty levels.  
- **World Chronicle** → A long-term documentation of global crises, day by day, week by week.  

In a global world, every observer is a member of the staff.  
This is our contribution: an **open staff report for all**.
